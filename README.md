# Data_and_Finance 
üëã Hi! Add your python programs for applications in finance like Time series analysis, Trading Strategies, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and more.

‚≠ê Star this repo for the support.

## ‚úå Why this Repository?
This repository gives beginners and newcomers in the field of AI, ML and Quants a chance to understand the inner workings of popular learning algorithms by presenting them with
a simple to analyze the implementation of ML and DL algorithms in pure python using only numpy as a backend for linear algebraic computations for the sake of efficiency.
This repository will be a place to contribute and look into the world how programming can change the way trading happens and who has an edge over whom.

‚úç <b>Your Algorithms can be a very simple and beginner friendly to a competitive and game changer in real world applications as well.</b>

## üôå  What you should contribute? Read the [CONTRIBUTIONS](https://github.com/aditya172926/Data_and_Finance/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
Contribute your Scripts or applications implementing the algorithms in following domains:- 
- Finance
- Data Analysis
- Algorithmic Trading
- Machine Learning
- Visualization
- Time series
- and more that you can think of.

You can even refer Kaggle if you want to do any analysis from any dataset. But the analysis must be provided with some observations you made so to call it your work.
