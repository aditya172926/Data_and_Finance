# django_analytics_dashboard
This is a dashboard for visualizing the data given as input in the admin panel of the dashboard. It uses flexmonster for plotting the data. 

Make a virtual environment for this project, check the requirements.txt file for the packages to be installed.
Currently the data needs to be filled in the Admin portal to be visualized in the frontend. Further modifications will enable the site to accept excel and csv files to directly
import the data in the website.

For later we are planning to replace the flexmoster api with good plots using Plotly python module or an api.
